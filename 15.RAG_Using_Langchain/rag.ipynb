Unstable radioactive nuclei, such as uranium-235, can emit strong radiations.\\n2.  When the nucleus of uranium-235 is bombarded with a neutron, it absorbs the neutron, forming a highly unstable compound nucleus, uranium-236.\\n3.  This unstable uranium-236 nucleus then splits into two product nuclei: barium-141 and krypton-92.\\n4.  In addition to these two nuclei, three neutrons are also emitted, along with a high amount of energy (denoted as 'q' in the chemical equation). For instance, breaking up uranium-235 emits 200 million times the energy of the neutron which triggered it.\\n5.  The three neutrons emitted can then be absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, leading to a chain reaction that results in exponentially high amounts of energy being released.\\n\\nThe discovery of this process was made in 1939 by German scientist Otto Hahn, along with his colleagues Lisa Meitner and Fritz Strassmann.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run--25fdf498-ece2-45c7-a47c-b54da956cbb9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 744, 'output_tokens': 274, 'total_tokens': 1971, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"
